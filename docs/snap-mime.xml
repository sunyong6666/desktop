    This file is from https://desktop.turbowarp.org/snap-mime.xml
    It should be saved to /usr/share/mime/packages/turbowarp-desktop-snap.xml
    Run sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime after creating or deleting this file.

    Canonical, in their infinite wisdom, do not let apps installed from snap install additional MIME
    types to your system's database (flatpak does not have this restriction). sb2 and sb3 files are
    actually zips so some file managers will treat them as zip files and prevent you from changing
    the associated app without also affecting normal zip files. This is an objectively awful user
    experience.

    This file will tell your system that sb, sb2, and sb3 files should be treated separately so you
    can set TurboWarp (or any other app) as the associated app without affecting normal zip files.
